Titanic Survival Prediction
This project leverages the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival outcomes. Using features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin details, the model aims to determine whether a passenger survived the ill-fated voyage. A classic beginner's machine learning challenge, this project provides hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms. Dive into this dataset to explore the factors influencing survival and develop predictive models with real-world implications.
